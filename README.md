Your quest is over. You've found this hopefully helpful source code to help you as you go through the exercises in the video course.

There are **seven sections** in the video, so there are seven folders in this repository.

Code files are named like this:

    <SectionNumber>_<VideoNumber>_Filename.<extension>

So if you are looking for `run.csx` from video **2.2**, the file can be found in:

`section2/2_2_run.csx`

In some videos we create multiple files with the same name. In those cases I'll name them with an identifier to help:

`section3/3_3b_Twilio.run.csx`

This is the **Twilio** source code from video **3.3**. (I put the **b** in the file name so it sorts in the order it is used in the video).
